                           The feellings about this challenge was very good, because I learned a lot about the different methods to extract information about people and companies to attack them with phishing or osint techniques.

                            I think I could improve my practice testing more phishing and osint techniques on different targets, to see how they behave and how to detect them.

The default setting is ON, and this configuration is recommended because it improves space management and data recovery by allowing tables to be retrieved individually.
